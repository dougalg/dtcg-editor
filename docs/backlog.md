# Backlog

Planned features not yet in progress. Pick one and run `/sdd-feature` to start it.
Completed items are moved to `docs/backlog-completed.md` by `/sdd-archive`, not marked `[x]` here.

- [ ] Add support for additional "non-standard" behaviours, like custom fields
- [ ] Add support for "fontFamily" tokens
- [ ] Add support for "fontWeight" tokens
- [ ] Add support for "duration" tokens
- [ ] Add support for "cubicBezier" tokens
- [ ] Add support for "number" tokens
- [ ] Add support for "strokeStyle" tokens
- [ ] Add support for "border" tokens
- [ ] Add support for "transition" tokens
- [ ] Add support for "shadow" tokens
- [ ] Add support for "gradient" tokens
- [ ] Add support for "typography" tokens
- [ ] Allow the user/configurer to specify in config additional non-standard token types to support. They must also register an editor for it, or the config is invalid. This should be enforced via build-time script checks and TS checks for fast feedback.
- [ ] Improve UI/UX
- [ ] Upgrade `typescript` to v7 — blocked as of 2026-07-27: breaks `apps/web-app`'s build outright since Next.js 16.2.12 doesn't yet support TypeScript 7's new native compiler API ("TypeScript 7.0.2 does not provide the compiler API required by Next.js"); `@typescript-eslint@8.65.0` also only declares peer support up to `typescript<6.1.0`, so lint would likely break too. Verify Next.js and `@typescript-eslint` both support TypeScript 7 before attempting again.
- [ ] Add a regression guard for the `apps/web-app/instrumentation.ts` Edge Runtime `process.exit` fix — deferred as of 2026-07-28, not urgent since the fix itself resolves the current warning. If it recurs (e.g. a future change reintroduces an un-isolated `process.exit` or other Node-only API directly in `instrumentation.ts`), add either an ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` rule scoped to that file banning direct `process.exit` calls, or a CI step that greps `next build`'s output for Edge Runtime warnings and fails the build — both discussed but not implemented when the underlying fix shipped.
